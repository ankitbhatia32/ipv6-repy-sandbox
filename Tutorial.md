# Tutorial
This part explains the IPv6 implementation of Repy_V2. Tutorial will explain basic implmentation related to IPv6 and most importantly, the difference in the approach between IPv4 & IPv6 Repy_V2 and various issues faced. Python IPv6 socket networking function library has been helpful throughout the implementation, which is given [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html)
As we know with the given exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and the ever growing need of IP addresses, the world is moving from IPv4 to IPv6 addresses.
